# Bidirectional-Dijkstra
Given a directed graph , a source node and the target node , this program will find the path between source and target nodes having minimum weight.
This program is implementation of Bi-Directional Dijkstra's algorithm which can be very useful when graph is much dense such as 
graph which is formed by mutual friends or the peoples we follow on various social media platforms .
